# Python Fundamentals

## Before diving into the toolkit for Data Science, it is important to learn the fundamentals of Python.

### Python Basics
[Whirlwind Tour of Python - VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython) covers key concepts such as syntax, variables, operators, data structures, control flow, and more.

- If you do not know Python, this is a great place to start. Python also has some docs itself for folks getting started: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/
