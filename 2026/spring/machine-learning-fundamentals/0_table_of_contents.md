    - Key terms:
        - Machine Learning (ML): A field of AI where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming
        - Training Set: A dataset used to train a machine learning model by adjusting its parameters to minimize error
        - Testing Set: A dataset used to evaluate the performance of a trained model and estimate its generalization to new, unseen data
        - Supervised Learning: A type of ML where models learn from labeled data to predict outcomes
        - Unsupervised Learning: A type of ML where models find patterns or structures in unlabeled data
        - Regression: A supervised ML technique used to predict real-valued outcomes
        - Classification: A supervised ML technique for categorizing data into distinct classes
        - Clustering: An unsupervised ML technique that groups similar data points based on their features
        - Dimensionality Reduction: A ML technique that combines the information from multiple input variables into fewer dimensions, retaining the most important patterns and structure in the data
        - Prediction: Using a model to calculate outcomes based on new data not included in the training set
        - Inference: Drawing conclusions about relationships between variables in the data
        - Generalization: The ability of a machine learning model to perform well on new, unseen data by effectively capturing underlying patterns during training rather than memorizing the specific details of the training set
        - Reducible Error: The part of a model's error that can be minimized by improving the model 
        - Irreducible Error: The portion of the error that cannot be eliminated, caused by inherent noise or randomness in the data regardless of the model used
        - Bias (of a model): The error introduced by using a model that is too simple to capture the complexity of the underlying data patterns 
        - Variance: The error introduced because the model is too complex and sensitive to fluctuations in the training data, capturing noise along with the underlying pattern
        - Underfitting: A situation where the model is not complex enough, resulting in high bias 
        - Overfitting: A situation where the model is too complex, resulting in high variance 
        - Accuracy: Used formally to refer to the percentage of correct predictions for classification models; used informally to refer to how well a model performs 
        - Interpretability: The ability for a human to understand how a machine learning model makes decisions
        - Bias (of a dataset): Errors or distortions in the data that result in unfair or unequal outcomes, often reflecting societal inequalities or imbalanced data collection
        - Fairness: Ensuring models do not produce biased or discriminatory outcomes
