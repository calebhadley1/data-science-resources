    - Key concepts:
        - Data Integration
        - Data Wrangling vs Cleaning
        - ETL vs ELT
        - Data sources such as flat file, API, direct DB access, etc
        - Challenges with Data Integration including entity identification, redundancy and correlation, tuple duplication, and data conflict resolution
        - Integration types such as tight coupling (ETL/ELT), ​Manual Integration (ad hoc scripts), ​Middleware-based Integration (such as wrapper APIs), ​Application-based Integration (such as Azure Data Factory), Data Virtualization, ​Data Warehousing/Enterprise Data Warehousing, Data Lakes
        - ELT/ETL considerations:
            - Data availability and integration
            - Data transformation and quality
            - Scalability and performance
            - Compliance and governance

            - Flexibility and adaptability
        - Integration approaches
            - Batching, Streaming, and Hybrid
        - Best practices:
            - Start with a well defined strategy:
                - Business use cases, data sources and their roles, real time vs batch, and infra requirements for scaling
            - Data quality from the start
                - Data cleaning & enrichment early in the pipeline
                - Data validation rules to fix inconsistencies in the data
                - Regularly monitor and maintain data quality
            - Automate ETL/ELT where possible
            - Adopt scalable and flexible architectures
                - Modern solutions like AWS Glue
            - APIs and Middleware for Complex Integrations
            - Ensure Data Governance and Security
                - Metadata management to track and document data sources and transformations. 
                - Access controls
                - Compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. 
                - Encryption during data transfer and storage
            - Embrace Real-Time Integration for Fast Decision-Making where possible
            - Use Master Data Management (MDM)
            - Monitor and Optimize Performance
            - Plan for Future Growth and Evolution
            - Utilize Data Virtualization
