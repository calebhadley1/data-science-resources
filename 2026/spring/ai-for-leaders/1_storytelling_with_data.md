## Introduction
- We are not naturally good at storytelling with data. We learn writing and mathematics separate, not often applying both together (p. 2)
- The book will touch on 6 strategies for effectively storytelling with data:
    1. Understand the context
    2. Choose an appropriate visual display
    3. Eliminate clutter
    4. Focus attention where you want it
    5. Think like a designer
    6. Tell a story
## Chapter 1: The Importance of Context
- TODO
- Exploratory vs Explanatory Analysis
    - When presenting findings, we do not need to show the whole exploratory process. Focus on the findings
- Who, What and How
    - Who: Your audience (p. 21)
    - What: The action you want the audience to take (p. 23)
    - How: Use data to explain your point. How can we back up the argument for what action they should take? (p. 26)
- Identify your 3-minute pitch/big idea and use it to drive the analysis (p. 31)
