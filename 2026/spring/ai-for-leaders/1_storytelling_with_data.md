## Introduction
- We are not naturally good at storytelling with data. We learn writing and mathematics separate, not often applying both together (p. 2)
- The book will touch on 6 strategies for effectively storytelling with data:
    1. Understand the context
    2. Choose an appropriate visual display
    3. Eliminate clutter
    4. Focus attention where you want it
    5. Think like a designer
    6. Tell a story
## Chapter 1: The Importance of Context
- Exploratory vs Explanatory Analysis
    - When presenting findings, we do not need to show the whole exploratory process. Focus on the findings
- Who, What and How
    - Who: Your audience (p. 21)
    - What: The action you want the audience to take (p. 23)
    - How: Use data to explain your point. How can we back up the argument for what action they should take? (p. 26)
- Identify your 3-minute pitch/big idea and use it to drive the analysis (p. 31)
## Chapter 2: Choosing an Effective Visual
- Simple text (p. 38-39)
    - Useful when you have a number or two to share
- Tables (p. 40-41)
    - Good for communicating to a variety of audiences who will be interested in specific rows
    - Useful when multiple unit of measurement are needed
    - Not great in live presentations. Audiences cannot pay attention to the presentation when reading the table
- Heatmap (p. 42-43)
    - Table + visual cues by leveraging color to show magnitude
    - Make sure to use a legend
- Graphs (p. 43-44)
    - Interacts with our visual system instead of verbal (tables)
    - Easier to grok
- Points
    - Scatterplot (p. 44)
        - Shows relationship between two things
        - Useful mainly in scentific field, but applications to business as well
        - It can be helpful to include additional information like the average as another line on the graph (p. 45)
- Lines (p. 45-46)
    - Plots continuous data
    - Line graph (p. 46)
        - Make sure to use consistent y intervals
    - Slopegraph (p. 47-49)
        - Useful for comparing multiple lines
- Bars (p. 50 - 55)
    - Be mindful of bar size/width
    - Vertical bar chart (p. 54)
    - Stacked vertical bar chart (p. 55)
        - It can be hard to compare the stacked bars (fig 2.16)
    - Waterfall chart (p. 55-56)
    - Horizontal bar chart (p. 57)
        - Extremely easy to read
    - Stacked horizontal bar chart (p. 58)
- Area (p. 59)
    - The author reccomends avoiding these since humans can't translate quantitative information to 2d space well
- Other types of graphs
    - Avoid 3rd graphs, pie charts (p. 62-63)
    - Secondary y axis is generally not a good idea. It can be confusing to understand which data corresponds to which axis
