## Introduction
- We are not naturally good at storytelling with data. We learn writing and mathematics separate, not often applying both together (p. 2)
- The book will touch on 6 strategies for effectively storytelling with data:
    1. Understand the context
    2. Choose an appropriate visual display
    3. Eliminate clutter
    4. Focus attention where you want it
    5. Think like a designer
    6. Tell a story
