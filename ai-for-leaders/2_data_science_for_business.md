# [Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking](https://www.academia.edu/38731456/Data_Science_for_Business)

This book mainly covers case studies in Data Science across different business domains. It shows how DS can make an impact on business
and how data should be viewed as a business asset.

## Overview, Data and Uncertainty

Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Analytic Thinking
- The volume of data has surpassed the ability for statisticians and models to manually inspect data and derive insights. To address this Data Science has risen in popularity.
- Case Study 1: Hurricane Frances
    - Walmart utilizes DS to predict which items would be in demand for the hurricane. It came to counter-intuitive realizations that items such as strawberry PopTarts would be in demand. 
- Case Study 2: Customer Churn
    - MegaTelCo uses DS to identify which customers are likely to churn. By doing this they can target these customers with marketing campaigns. 
- Data Driven Decision Making (DDD) - The practice of basing decisions on the outcome of data analysis rather than intuition. A study on DDD @ MIT is covered to support its use. 
- Case Study 3: Target Pregnancy Predictions
    - Target and many other retailers compete to win the business of families which are welcoming new children. They know that children result in the buying habits changing (where you buy diapers is where you buy everything). Target had the realization that if it can predict *who* is pregnant, they can win their business before anyone even knows that the family has a new child. 
- For both case studies 1 & 3, the data is explored without a simple hypothesis with the hope that something useful can be uncovered. Case study 2 however has a basis hypothesis, predict who will churn. (Type 1 vs 2 DDD problems).
- Big Data 1.0 vs 2.0. First companies will learn how to process data (setup the plumbing). In 2.0, business will uncover all the different ways they can leverage this data.
- **Data should be viewed as a strategic asset** - Signet Bank to Capital One story. 
- Cross Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM).
- Data Science vs the Tools of Data Science (Analogy of how Chemists are not just the test tubes. Likewise Data Scienctists are not just Python, Pandas, Numpy etc. It is the science of discovering trends from data that is important)
