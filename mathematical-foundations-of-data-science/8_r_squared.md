Read | DS 701 Lecture Notes - Measuring the fit of a Regression Model: R-Squared. These lecture notes define R2, talk about the intuition behind their use, and warn of traps from similar notation from correlation that we will cover in a few weeks. The example of linear regression farther down on the page also includes evaluation and discussion of the resulting R2 values.

Read | Lecture Notes - Statistical Forecasting: Notes on Regression and Time Series Analysis, Whatâ€™s a Good Value for R-Squared?. These lecture notes talk about the limitations of R2 in assessing the quality of a model.
