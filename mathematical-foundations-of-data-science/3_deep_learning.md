## Overview, Data and Uncertainty

[Chapter 3 - Probability and Information Theory](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html)

3.1 - Why Probability?
- Discusses non-determinism (**stochasticity**) and uncertainty in Machine Learning
- 3 types of uncertainty:
    - Inherent stochastically - the system being modeled in non-deterministic
    - Incomplete observability - the subject thinks the system is non deterministic
    - Incomplete modeling - **When we use a model that must discard some of the information we have observed, the discarded information results in uncertainty in the modelâ€™s predictions.**
- In many cases a simple but uncertain rule can be more useful than a complex and certain one
- "Degree of belief"
- Frequentist prob
- Bayesian prob
