# [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf)


## Chapter 1: TODO
- These chapters talk about vectors more formally, and interleave many examples of applications.
### Section 1: TODO

### Section 2: TODO
### Section 3: TODO

## Chapter 2: Linear Functions
- This chapter introduces vectors and their broader context for linear algebra.
### Section 1: Linear Functions
- Function Notation
    - Explains how to write the notation like "f is a function that maps n real vectors to real numbers"
- The inner product function 
    - Essentially a weighted sum of the elements in a vector
- Superposition and linearity
    - A function that satisfies superposition is linear
    - Homogeneity
    - Additivity
- Inner product representation of a linear function
- Affine functions

## Chapter 3: Norm and Distance
### Section 1: TODO
- This reading defines the Euclidean norm, and general requirements for other norms
### Section 2: TODO
- This reading defines the Euclidean distance between two vectors, and general requirements for distance functions.
### Section 3: Standard Deviation
- The standard deviation of a vector x tells us the typical amount by which its entries deviate from their average value
- Covers standardization of the standard deviation with zscores

## Chapter 5: TODO
### Section 1: Linear Dependence (TODO)
- This reading defines linear dependence and independence.
