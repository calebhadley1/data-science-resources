## Sampling and Descriptive Statistics
### Descriptive Statistics
#### Chapter 3: Norm and Distance
##### Section 3: Standard Deviation
- The standard deviation of a vector x tells us the typical amount by which its entries deviate from their average value
- Covers standardization of the standard deviation with zscores

## What Models Do and Managing Model Errors
### What Do Models Do?
#### Chapter 2: Linear Functions
##### Section 1: Linear Functions
- Function Notation
    - Explains how to write the notation like "f is a function that maps n real vectors to real numbers"
- The inner product function 
    - Essentially a weighted sum of the elements in a vector
- Superposition and linearity
    - A function that satisfies superposition is linear
    - Homogeneity
    - Additivity
- Inner product representation of a linear function
- Affine functions
