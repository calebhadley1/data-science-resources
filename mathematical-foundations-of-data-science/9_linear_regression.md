[Linear Models](https://mcrovella.github.io/DS701-Tools-for-Data-Science/17-Regression-I-Linear.html)
- These lecture notes give historical context on the development of linear regression and sketch the analytic solution.
- Compares classification to regression: "It is a form of supervised learning: whereas classification deals with predicting categorical features (labels or classes), regression deals with predicting continuous features (real values)"
- Describes the framework for calculating regression lines and terminology such as:
    - Design matrix (indep vars, matrix X)
    - Observation matrix (dependent vars, vector y)
    - Parameter vector (model params)
    - Observed vs predicted
    - Residuals
    - Least squares line (minimizes the sum of the squares of the risiduals)
    - Regression coefficients
    - Multiple regression
    - R^2



Mathematics for Machine Learning, Chapter 9-9.2.2: Linear Regression. 
- This chapter motivates linear regression from the problem of modeling noisy data, presenting the same linear regression formula as a maximum likelihood solution.
