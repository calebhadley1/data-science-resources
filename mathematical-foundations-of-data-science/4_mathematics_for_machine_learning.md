## Chapter 6
### Section 4
- Means and Covariances
    - Mean and (co)variance are often useful to describe properties of probability distributions (expected values and spread). We will see in Section 6.6 that there is a useful family of distributions (called the exponential family), where the statistics of the random variable capture all possible information.
- Expected Value: "The expected value serves as a fundamental concept to evaluate models, frame problems, and guide decision-making within a business context by using the Expected Value Framework to quantify potential costs and benefits of a model's probabilistic predictions."
- Median
    - For distributions, which are asymmetric or have long tails, the median provides an estimate of a typical value that is closer to human intuition than the mean value
    - More robust to outliers than mean
- Mean
- Mode
- Covariance
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Correlation
- Population vs Sample
