- This book covers foundations concepts of Statistics.

## Overview, Data and Uncertainty
- Chapter 1.1
    - This chapter provides defintions for key concepts such as:
        - Population
        - Sample
        - Variable
        - Data
        - Descriptive Statistics vs Inferential Statistics
        - Census
        - Parameter
        - Quan/Qualitative
        - Observational/Designed experiments
        - Placebo/Treatments
        - Sampling strategies (Random, Representative, Clustering/Stratified, Systematic, and Convenience)

    - Chapter 1.1 Excersise Sols:
        - Identify the population, sample, parameters, and statistics for the following situation.
        A textbook company wants to know the average price of homeschool science textbooks
        in the United States. They obtain a list of 15 science books and compute the average
        price of the 15 books is $52.
            - Population: All homeschool Science Textbooks in the US
            - Sample: 15 Science Books
            - Parameters: Population average price of all the books
            - Stats: Average of 15 books = 52$

        - A teenager put the following information on his myspace page. What are the variables,
        what are their values, which variables are qualitative, which are quantitative? Name:
        Sean Higgins, Ht: 5ft.10in., Wt: 185 lbs., Eyes: Green, Hair: Red, Page-hits: 142
            - Variables: name, height, weight, eye_color, hair_color, page_hits
            - Values: sean 5ft10, 185, green, red, 142
            - Qualitative: nam, eye and hair color
            - Quantitative: height, weight, page hits

        - Use systematic sampling to select 7 people out of a group of 6700. State the place
        numbers of the selected sample.
            - One such systematic method is to take the sample size & divide by 7 rounding down, we will call it n, split the sample into groups of n, take the mth person in each group of n

        - Does the following describe an experiment or just an observational study? Explain
        why. Sarah was on a field trip for her science class. At the beach, she saw a sand castle
        with 2 crabs crawling inside it. She timed the crabs to see how long they took to find
        their way out.
            - Observational because Sarah is not involved in what the crabs are doing. She did not impose treatments or try to control anything

        - Which type of sampling best fits the following? Explain why. DJ Paulie D is looking
        for some songs to be the background beats for his new mix. He sorts his ipod collection
        into four categories: Rap, Instrumental, Dance, and Alternative. Then he randomly
        picks 5 songs from each category and listens to the beats.
            - Music genre stratified samples. It is not clustering because in clustering groups are created and entire group is used

        - What is a census? The US government does a census every ten years. Why don’t they
        do one every year? Is the US census an actual census? Why or why not?
            - Census is a recording of data about the entire population
            - Every 10 years because it is very rigorous and requires a ton of resourcing
            - Nah because the entire population does not participate. US Census does some changes to the data as a result to make it represntative

        - Which sampling methods tend to have bias? Explain how they have bias.
            - Convenience sampling since it results in similar sample points (i.e. people you are close to may have similar location, age etc)
            - Stratified is usually the best
            - Systematic does not allow most of the combinations to be picked
            - Cluster can be biased if people in the same cluster have similar charactristics
            - Simple is not biased methodology wise, but the sample could be biased

        - Why do experimenters use placebos? How do they use them?
            - Double blind with placebos prevents any bias from the conductor of the experiment or the participator.

        - Which samples are representative of their populations, which are not? Explain why.
            (a) A marketing firm wants to know how much time teenagers spend on youtube.
            They post ads to take their survey on the top ten youtube videos.
            (b) A large company wants to know how far their employees drive to work. They pick
            employees from several cities, several different job levels, and a mix of young and
            older employees.
            - (a): Nope, only people watching top ten youtube videos participate. What about teenagers who watch no youtube videos?
            - (b): Nice

## Sampling and Descriptive Statistics
- Chapter 1.2
    - Distributions
        - What values the variable takes on and how often
    - Classes (Data is often grouped according to these)
        - Categories or groupings
        - Numerical data is grouped in consecutive intervals (e.g. 0 - 0.99, 1.0 - 1.99)
        - Class midpoint
        - Class boundaries (# halfway between upper and lower limits of class. For the example above it would be like 0.995)
        - Class width
            - The difference between consecutive
            lower limits, or consecutive upper limits, or consecutive midpoints, or consecutive boundaries
        - Guidelines for creating classes
            1. Small number of classes to be effective, but enough to show differences.
            2.  Each observation must belong to only one class, the classes MUST NOT overlap.
            3. Whenever feasible, classes should have same width.
        - “…compute the Frequency of each class, which is the number of observations that
        fall into a class (count). A listing of all classes of the data and their frequencies is called a
        Frequency distribution”
        - “When data sets are different sizes, it is hard to compare them. A good way to compare
        is to compute Relative Frequency, which is the ratio of the frequency of a class to the
        total number of observations. A listing of all classes and their relative frequencies is called a
        Relative Frequency distribution. Most distributions show frequencies as well as relative
        frequencies.”
        - Cumulative frequencies (running tally)
    - Histograms (quant data)
        - Frequency vs relative frequency hist
    - Pie chart
    - Bar chart (qual data/categories)
        - Pareto chart = ordered bar chart by freq
    - Things to note when reading graphs:
        - Center: where is the middle of the graph, and the highest point.
        - Spread: how are the parts of the graph spread out from each other?
        - Shape: what shape does the graph have? Bell shape, straight across (uniform), repeatedly up and down, random?
        - Symmetry: graph can be split in half with two mirror image parts, almost equal
        amount on both sides of the peak. Uniform graphs (level straight across) are also
        technically symmetric.
        - Skewness A graph that extends more out to left side of the peak (high point) is called
        Left-skewed. A graph that extends more out to right side of the peak (high point) is
        called Right-skewed.
        21
        - Outliers: are data values (small parts of the graph) that are far from the other data
        (parts).
    - Time series graphs
    - Chapter 1.2 Exercise Solutions:
        1. When grouping data into classes, why should we use only a small number of classes? If a data set has 1000 values, why not use 100 classes?
            - Too much granularity for the classes to be useful

        1. When computing relative frequencies, how do we know that we have calculated them correctly?
            - They must add to 100%
        2. For the classes shown below, state the lower limits, upper limits, midpoints, and boundaries, then find the class width.
        1-23 24-46 47-69 70-92 93-115
            - lower limits = 1, 24, 47, 70, 93
            - upper limits = 23, 46, 69, 92, 115
            - midpoints = 12, 35, 58, …
            - boundaries = 23.5, 46.5, …
            - class width = 23
        3. What is the difference between a bar graph and a Pareto chart? Can a Pareto chart be done from quantitative data? Why or why not?
            - Pareto is a bar graph for qualitative data (classes). It cannot be used for quant data, that would just be a bar chart.
        4. Group the following data, calculate the frequencies and relative frequencies. Convert relative frequencies to nearest whole percent. A Farmer kept a log for one month of which days it rained. Here is the order. Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Friday, Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday, Friday, Tuesday
            - Classes = M,T,W,Th,F,Sat,Sun except you can remove any which have no values I think
            - Tuesday freq = 3, rel freq = 3/10
        5. Make a pie-chart and a bar graph for the distribution you created from the farmer’s
        observations in the previous exercise.
            - N/A
        6. Group the following data into classes, calculate the frequencies and relative frequencies.
        Convert relative frequencies to nearest tenth of a percent. The grades on a history test
        were as follows: 67, 72, 99, 100, 82, 83, 94, 90, 80, 85, 85, 77, 48, 88, 75, 50, 75, 82,
        and 95. Use Classes of under 60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and 90-100.
            - Classes = 0-60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-100
            - Freqs = 2 for 0-60, 1, for 60-69, etc.
            - Relative freqs = 2/19, 1/19, …

        7. Make a pie-chart and a histogram for the distribution you created from the history
        grades in the previous exercise.
            - N/A
        8. The Covid-19 fully vaccinated rates for the 50 US states are shown in the distribution below. Fill in the missing values. The data comes from [www.usafacts.org](http://www.usafacts.org/) as of May 15th, 2022. The lowest rate is 51% in Wyoming. The highest rate is 83% in Rhode Island.
            - N/A
        9. Describe the characteristics of the following graph (center, spread, shape, symmetry,
        outliers).
            - Center is at 6, spread is moderate, concentrated from 5-8, shape is bell shape ish, not perfectly symmetrical, outlier to the left
        10. Describe two issues that are bad or misleading about the following graph.
            - Data does not start at 0, exaggerating the differences. Pareto bar chart is ok, but the classes do not indicate what they are describing

- Chapter 1.3
    - Notations
    - Sigma X = the sum of elements in X
    - Descriptive measures - mean, med, max, etc
        - Measures of Center
            - Sample mean (x bar)
            - Population mean (mu)
            - Median
            - Mode
            - These stats are sensitive to extreme values
            - left skewed datasets the mean is less than median
            - Using Frequency distribution to calculate mean
            - Weighted mean
        - Measures of Variation
            - “Measures of Variation (or measures of spread) are descriptive measures that indicate how much variation is in the data or how spread out the data values are from each other.”
            - Min, max, range, std
            - std of sample = s
            - variance of sample = s^2
            - std of population = omega
            - variance of pop = omega^2
            - We can compare the std of two similar datasets
            - When they are not similar, we use Coefficient of Variation
    - Chapter 1.3 Exercise Solutions:
        1. Compute the mean, median, and mode of the following data sets. Use the round-off rule.
        (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        (b) 1, -2, 0, 3, 4, 0
        (c) 123, 318, 222, 301, 188, 195, 253, 172, 230, 103, 155, 281
            - To compute mean, sum the numbers and divide by the len
            - To compute median, sort the numbers and find the middle element. Apply round off rule
            - To compute mode, count occurrences and return highest
        2. For the following data, compute the mean, median, and mode. Use the round-off rule.
        The grades on a history test were as follows: 67, 72, 99, 100, 82, 83, 94, 90, 80, 85, 85,
        77, 48, 88, 75, 50, 75, 82, and 95
            - To compute mean, sum the numbers and divide by the len
            - To compute median, sort the numbers and find the middle element. Apply round off rule
            - To compute mode, count occurrences and return highest
        3. For the following data, compute the min, max, range, variance and standard deviation.
        One of the hottest selling concerts of 2013 was the Honda Civic Tour featuring Maroon
        5, Kelly Clarkson, and Rozzi Crane. A sample of ticket prices for the Atlanta Lakewood
        show on August 1st were $44, $74, $94, and $116.
            - Min 44, Max 116, Range 44-116 inclusive, std dev = sqrt(sum of the squared differences between mean and the element) / len - 1)
        4. Explain what the standard deviation from the previous exercise tells you about the
        ticket prices.
            - It tells us whether the average element is far from the mean
        5. How are the mean, median and mode affected by extreme values?
            - Extreme values can mean the mean non-representative. For example, salary calculations are skewed by high earners, making the mean seem decent. The median is a better stat in this case. The mode is not affected either
        6. If a set of data is not known to be from a sample or a population, then there are
        two possible standard deviation formulas to use. Explain why the sample standard
        deviation is always larger than the population standard deviation.
            - Bessel's correction gives it a small upward bias
        7. College GPA is a weighted average of the grades earned in all of your courses. Letter
        grades are equated to a numeric value called quality points. The weights are the credit
        hours earned for the course. On a typical A-F system with no plus/minus, the points
        40 are A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, and F = 0. If a student had the following
        grades for their first semester, what would their GPA be for that semester? Grade B
        in College Algebra(3 credits), Grade B in Chemistry(4 credits), Grade A in Phys Ed(2
        credits), Grade C in Writing(3 credits), Grade A in Economics(3 credits).
            - Setup a division with the den/num as follows
            - Calculate the denominator as 3*3 + 3*4 + 4*2 + 2*3 + 4 * 3
            - Calculate numerator as 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3
        8. A fitness company did a study and found the following statistics for 1000 women in
        the Atlanta area. Mean weight = 162 pounds, median weight = 141 pounds, standard
        deviation = 45 pounds. What do these statistics suggest about the distribution of
        women’s weights?
            - This shows that there are some outliers which are shifting the mean. The mean is greater than the median, so it is right skewed. The standard deviation shows the average woman is 45 pounds from the mean.
        9. Estimate the mean of the following frequency distribution.
        Class 10-14 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39
        Frequency 12 5 7 2 6 3
            - First find the midpoints for each class. Then setup a division with the denominator as sum[i..x](midpoint[x] * freq[x]) and numerator as sum(freq)
        10. Which data set is more spread out, the shot put throws for a high school track team:
        s = 5.5 feet and x = 38 feet, or the gymnastics scores for a college team: s = 1.4
        points and x = 8.45 points?
            - Since they are different measurements you need to compare them relatively

- Chapter 1.4
    - Measures of Relative Standing (measures that describe how particular data values compare to each other)
    - Z Scores
        - The number of standard deviations that a given
        value is above or below its mean
        - Usual values are z-scores from −2 to +2.
        - Z = X - mean(x) / std
    - Percentiles
        - Quartiles (every 25th percentile), Q1, Q2, Q3. Q2 = P50
        - Methods for calculating percentiles
    - Boxplots
    - Chapter 1.4 Exercise Solutions:
        - 1. IQ scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Compute the z-scores of the famous people below and state which ones are unusual.
            Name IQ score
            Garry Kasporov (chess champion) 190
            Albert Einstein (scientist) 160
            Arnold Schwarzenegger (actor) 135
            Tim Tebow (football player) 104
            Howard Stern (talk radio host) 99
            George W Bush (43rd president) 125
            Muhammad Ali (boxer) 78
            Barack Obama (44th president) 130
            - Z Scores:
                - Garry: 190 - 100 / 15 = ..
        2. Heights of adult males have a mean of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. How tall must a man be to be considered unusually short or unusually tall?
            - Unusually tall will be z scores -2 < z > 2
            - First lets solve for the -2 case
            - -2 = (X - 69) / 3  ->  -6 = X - 69  ->  X=63. So over 63 inches is unusually tall. You can do the same logic for the 2 case
        3. For a data set with 38 values, compute the location (position) of the 45th percentile.
            - 38 * (45/100) = 17.1. This means percentile is at the 17th position in the array
        4. If a student scores at the 85th percentile on a standardized test, what does that mean?
            - It means their score is higher or equal to than 85% of other students
        5. Find the Five-Number summary for 17, 7, 9, 10, 8, 7, 14, 20, 8, 5, 15, and 8.
            - Min, 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles, and Max
            - Order them, then use the calculation len(x) * (25/100) = some number. Once you find this number you can iterate over the array to grab the correct num.
        6. For the following grades on a history test, compute the Five-Number summary. 67, 72, 99, 100, 82, 83, 94, 90, 80, 85, 85, 77, 48, 88, 75, 50, 75, 82 and 95.
        Did the class do well on the test? Explain.
            - Same steps as above problem. Calculate the summary and see how high the mean is, see if any students did really poorly (min and 25th percentiles)
        7. Create a regular box-plot for the data in the previous exercise.
            - N/A
        8. Compute the lower and upper fences for the history test data and state which values, if any, are outliers. Then create a modified boxplot.
            - N/A
        9. Based on the boxplots below, state the characteristics of the data sets. Which one is more spread out?
            - N/A
