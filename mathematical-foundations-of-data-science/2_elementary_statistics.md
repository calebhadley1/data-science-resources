- This book covers foundations concepts of Statistics.

[Chapter 1.1](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/system/actioncallout/0/5/3/053a1575-131e-4626-904c-884ca823cde2/attachment/e20ed4251d26feb80dc432bd0497cb68.pdf#page=[3])

This chapter provides defintions for key concepts such as:
- Population
- Sample
- Variable
- Data
- Descriptive Statistics vs Inferential Statistics
- Census
- Parameter
- Quan/Qualitative
- Observational/Designed experiments
- Placebo/Treatments
- Sampling strategies (Random, Representative, Clustering/Stratified, Systematic, and Convenience)

Chapter 1.1 Excersise Sols:
- Identify the population, sample, parameters, and statistics for the following situation.
A textbook company wants to know the average price of homeschool science textbooks
in the United States. They obtain a list of 15 science books and compute the average
price of the 15 books is $52.
    - Population: All homeschool Science Textbooks in the US
    - Sample: 15 Science Books
    - Parameters: Population average price of all the books
    - Stats: Average of 15 books = 52$

- A teenager put the following information on his myspace page. What are the variables,
what are their values, which variables are qualitative, which are quantitative? Name:
Sean Higgins, Ht: 5ft.10in., Wt: 185 lbs., Eyes: Green, Hair: Red, Page-hits: 142
    - Variables: name, height, weight, eye_color, hair_color, page_hits
    - Values: sean 5ft10, 185, green, red, 142
    - Qualitative: nam, eye and hair color
    - Quantitative: height, weight, page hits

- Use systematic sampling to select 7 people out of a group of 6700. State the place
numbers of the selected sample.
    - One such systematic method is to take the sample size & divide by 7 rounding down, we will call it n, split the sample into groups of n, take the mth person in each group of n

- Does the following describe an experiment or just an observational study? Explain
why. Sarah was on a field trip for her science class. At the beach, she saw a sand castle
with 2 crabs crawling inside it. She timed the crabs to see how long they took to find
their way out.
    - Observational because Sarah is not involved in what the crabs are doing. She did not impose treatments or try to control anything

- Which type of sampling best fits the following? Explain why. DJ Paulie D is looking
for some songs to be the background beats for his new mix. He sorts his ipod collection
into four categories: Rap, Instrumental, Dance, and Alternative. Then he randomly
picks 5 songs from each category and listens to the beats.
    - Music genre stratified samples. It is not clustering because in clustering groups are created and entire group is used

- What is a census? The US government does a census every ten years. Why donâ€™t they
do one every year? Is the US census an actual census? Why or why not?
    - Census is a recording of data about the entire population
    - Every 10 years because it is very rigorous and requires a ton of resourcing
    - Nah because the entire population does not participate. US Census does some changes to the data as a result to make it represntative

- Which sampling methods tend to have bias? Explain how they have bias.
    - Convenience sampling since it results in similar sample points (i.e. people you are close to may have similar location, age etc)
    - Stratified is usually the best
    - Systematic does not allow most of the combinations to be picked
    - Cluster can be biased if people in the same cluster have similar charactristics
    - Simple is not biased methodology wise, but the sample could be biased

- Why do experimenters use placebos? How do they use them?
    - Double blind with placebos prevents any bias from the conductor of the experiment or the participator.

- Which samples are representative of their populations, which are not? Explain why.
    (a) A marketing firm wants to know how much time teenagers spend on youtube.
    They post ads to take their survey on the top ten youtube videos.
    (b) A large company wants to know how far their employees drive to work. They pick
    employees from several cities, several different job levels, and a mix of young and
    older employees.
    - (a): Nope, only people watching top ten youtube videos participate. What about teenagers who watch no youtube videos?
    - (b): Nice
